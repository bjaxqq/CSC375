# CSC375

## Course Description

This course explores advanced computer science topics not available in other courses, as well as new topics as they emerge in this rapidly evolving discipline. Topics may be interdisciplinary. It is a follow up course to the Quinnipiac CSC215 course.

## Tools and Languages Used

For this course we were allowed to use any coding language we wanted to complete coding assignments. I went with Python as that is what I use for my internship and feel the most comfortable with.
