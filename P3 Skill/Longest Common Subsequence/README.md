# Longest Common Subsequence

## Skill Description

## Assignment Instructions

P3. Implement an efficient solution to a problem that uses dynamic programming

Write a program that reads in three strings and outputs the *longest common subsequence* among those three strings.

1. You can assume the three strings use just the letters A-Z.
2. Ties can be broken arbitrarily. That is, any common subsequence of the same longest length is acceptable.
3. Group work is allowed - groups of up to 5 people. To give credits to all members, you must list everyone on the team in the comments of your code.
4. Assignment is due by Friday (2/16) before class as we will review the solution on Friday.

### Sample Run 1:

```
PS> java LCS3 EXAMPLE STAPLER MAPLE
Longest common subsequence is APLE
Length of longest common subsequence is 4
```

### Sample Run 2:

```
PS> java LCS3 CAAGCTGTA TAACGGCTC ATCCTGTTTA
Longest common subsequence is ACGT
Length of longest common subsequence is 4
```
